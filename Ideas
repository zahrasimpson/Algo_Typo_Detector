Qwerty Keyboard 
4 rows, 10 columns 

General idea: map every key to an interger via a character array -> 40 keys mapped, associative hash map (table) 
Basic To do List 
Test code to test basic cases of inserting, deleting, substituting, 


1. How you can break down a large problem instance into one or more smaller instances? 
Your answer should include how the solution to the original problem is constructed from the sub- problems.
Since we know the certain types of typos that need to be identified we can run through the entire sting when 
you encounter a difference we should run the function that identifies the difference AND the cost.

------------------------------
In std dynamic programming has two phases the forward phase and the backward phase. 
In the forward phase, we compute the cost for each subproblem. 
In the backward phase, we reconstruct the solution that gives the optimal cost. 

------------------------------
The cost will be stored in the matrix, making sure to only go through the string once. 
Then we can go into the matrix and reconstruct the path, 
------------------------------
Recurrence Relation: cost(An,Bm), where A and B are our strings and n, m represent the positions within the string. 
An and Bm are the last characters within the strings.

We can store the if statements with each individual case of substitution, deletion, insertion, and transposition 
within functions for each of those 4 cases.

cost(An,Bm) = minimum(
  cost(An-1,Bm-1) + substitution(An,Bm);
  cost(An,Bm-1)   + insertion(Bm);
  cost(An-1,Bm)   + deletion(An);
  cost(An-2,Bm-2) + transposition(An,Bm);
)

Base Case:  empty strings.

Notes from video:
if they aren't the same, we take the minumum of left right and top diagonal and then add one.
diagonal means: converting character from one to another
diagonal and same: no action
left: deleted the character
